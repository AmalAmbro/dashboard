This is a customizable dashboard template. It doesn't have much screens as of now.
I'm using Primevue and tailwind for components and styling.


You can clone this repo and install dependencies using following command

```
npm install
```

This will install required deps and start working on adding yours screens under pages folder. 
It will automatically create routes for those pages
